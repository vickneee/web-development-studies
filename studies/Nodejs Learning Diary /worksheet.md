# Node.js Learning Diary

## Date: 03.03.2024

### Main Points of the Lecture:
The main points of the lectures were to learn how to use Node.js with databases (both SQL and MongoDB). Additionally, the lectures covered creating and using REST APIs while focusing on securing them, as well as using Postman for testing. Express.js and testing were also parts of the study material.

### Prior Knowledge:
During my school programming course classes, I was recently actively working on a MERN full-stack project. I had some prior knowledge of REST APIs and MongoDB but needed to deepen my understanding of securing REST APIs. While I was familiar with Node.js, I lacked experience with Express.js. Additionally, I had no prior knowledge of code testing.

### New Learning:
I learned about code testing for the first time, and I feel like I need to understand it better. I also introduced myself to the Pug Template engine and Azure deployment for the first time, but right now, I don't think I need to learn more about them.

### Specific Interesting Points:
I found REST APIs, securing REST APIs, and testing particularly interesting.

### Questions Arising:
During the MongoDB section, I had questions about certain aspects. In our school project, we organized our code using a separate controllers folder in addition to routes and model folders, which made following the MongoDB instructions a bit outdated for me. In the lectures, they also used examples with the require module, but with the new ES6, we can use also import and export. So, I created my own versions of the code for that part of the course. 

### Desired Further Understanding:
I'd like to learn and understand more about code testing and MongoDB aggregations (I found that on YouTube and want to know more about that). I need to practice more how to connect Node.js and SQL databases. That part of the course was, at the moment, challenging. It needs just more practicing.

### Meaning and Future Use:
I will definitely use Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, securing REST APIs, Postman, MongoDB, and code testing in my future as a developer. I could also need to use SQL databases, which I learned about a year ago at the Vantaan Ammattiopisto Varia and Metropolitan course, but I haven't had any chance to use my knowledge yet. I will definitely need to practice that part of the course more.

## Conclusion:
These lectures were very interesting to learn and practice. There were many chances to practice, which I liked a lot.
