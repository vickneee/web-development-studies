# Metropolia UAS React.js Learning Diary

## Date: 14.03.2024

### Main Points of the Lecture:
The main points of the lectures were to learn how to use React.js framework. 

Additionally, the lectures covered creating and using REST APIs while focusing on securing them, as well as using Postman for testing. Express.js and testing were also parts of the study material.

### Prior Knowledge:
During my school programming classes, I was recently actively working on a MERN full-stack project. I had some prior knowledge of REST APIs and MongoDB but needed to deepen my understanding of securing REST APIs. While I was familiar with Node.js and SQL, I lacked experience with Express.js. Additionally, I had no prior knowledge of code testing.

### New Learning:
I learned about code testing for the first time, and I feel like I need to understand it better. I also introduced myself to the Pug Template engine and Azure deployment for the first time, but right now, I don't think I need to learn more about them.

### Specific Interesting Points:
I found securing REST APIs particularly interesting. Also, databases MySQL, PostgresSQL and MongoDB are my favourite. I spent a lot of time understanding and practicing them. I made a small GitHub project to practice and understand them better. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Postman came more familiar to me.

### Questions Arising:
I faced the SQL and Node.js part with the problem that my macOS computer could not be able to download the recommended PostgresSQL server and GUI. I tried it many times. I tried even different versions (16, 15, and 14). I found out later in instruction it says version 12, but my macOS is not even able to download that. I picked up my other macOS, and the issue was still there. It was frustrating, and I decided to use MySQL, which is familiar to me. I believe it should not be a problem. It was still challenging, but at least things worked out. It took me more than one day. Finally, I got a good understanding of my code and even connected my MySQL database to the WebStorm IDE.

I found a solution to the PostgreSQL download problem a few days later. I found a way to download different app of PostgresSQL server (It named Postgres.app) and another GUI (It named DbVisualizer). I was happy to find a solution and finished the PostgresSQL part of the course, but I was no longer able to add a solution.

During the MongoDB section, I had questions about certain aspects. In our school project, we organized our code using separate folders for controllers, routes, and models. This made following the MongoDB instructions a bit challenging for me. In the lectures, they also used examples with the require module, but with the new ES6, we can use also import and export. I created my own version of the code for that part of the course.

### Desired Further Understanding:
I'd like to learn and understand more about code testing and MongoDB aggregations (I found that on YouTube and want to know more about that).

### Meaning and Future Use:
I will definitely use Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, securing REST APIs, Postman, SQL, MongoDB, and code testing in my future as a developer.

## Conclusion:
These lectures were very interesting to learn and practice. There were many chances to practice, which I liked a lot, and I learned many new things. Overall, that course was very beneficial.
